   ** Warning ** No Timestep object found.  Number of TimeSteps in Hour defaulted to 4.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a zone sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Zone input object. SimulationControl Zone Sizing option ignored.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a plant sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Plant object input. SimulationControl Plant Sizing option ignored.
   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=GUANGZHOU
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=Guangzhou Guangdong CHN CSWD WMO#=592870
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[4.00E-002] degrees, Longitude difference=[1.00E-002] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[0.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[78.26] percent, [18.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** GlobalGeometryRules: Potential mismatch of coordinate specifications. Note that the rectangular surfaces are relying on the default SurfaceGeometry for 'Relative to zone' coordinate.
   **   ~~~   ** Coordinate System="WORLD"; while 
   **   ~~~   ** Rectangular Surface Coordinate System="RELATIVE".
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: World Coordinate System selected.  Any non-zero Building/Zone North Axes or non-zero Zone Origins are ignored.
   **   ~~~   ** These may be used in daylighting reference point coordinate calculations but not in normal geometry inputs.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=B1F_PUBLIC_FLOOR_1
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** GetVertices: Roof/Ceiling is upside down! Tilt angle=[180.0], should be near 0, Surface="B1F_PUBLIC_CEILING_1", in Zone="B1F_PUBLIC".
   **   ~~~   ** Automatic fix is attempted.
   ** Warning ** GetVertices: Roof/Ceiling is upside down! Tilt angle=[180.0], should be near 0, Surface="B1F_RETAIL_CEILING_1", in Zone="B1F_RETAIL".
   **   ~~~   ** Automatic fix is attempted.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 2 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings;
